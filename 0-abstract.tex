
Constructing IAI systems and Virtual Humans is, in practice, challenging in unexpected ways as they are typically built from disparate components operating in different ways.
This can impair research into these systems by raising the "barrier to entry" since a researcher needs to come to grips with how the different components behave and interact.
By building a unifying interoperation framework based around the ideas of Functional Reactive Programming (FRP), many of these difficulties can be mitigated.
This paper discusses the difficulties, explain how FRP can help to compartmentalize these concerns, before discussing our approach to put this into practice and outlining how we'd like to verify the viability of this approach.
