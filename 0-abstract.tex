Building, debugging, and testing IAI systems is in practice very difficult because as they typically are built from components from different sources using disparate underlying frameworks. By building a unifying interoperation framework based around the ideas of Functional Reactive Programming (FRP), many of these difficulties can be mitigated. This paper discusses the difficulties, explain how FRP can help, reports on our progress thus far, and outlines the future experiments we are going to carry out to further verify our hypothesis.
