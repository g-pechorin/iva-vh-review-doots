A 2013 witjkshop tutorial\cite{gratch_virtual_2013} identifided virtual humans as exisitng in a virtual world while interacting with real one
	[potetnial uses to replicate human behaviour or even just study it]
[- making use of them for resarch requires integrating tools and sofreaw features from mayy sources]
[- essential feature of this is coordinating the system and ensureing that the ensuing simpualtion proceeds]
	[- need an approach that managaes time in explicit eays]



The following year held a confrence
virtual humans existing 




# summary

cognitive scince tutorial from 2013

vh are defined as virtual characters that existing in a virtual work, but, can interact with real ones

the paper suggests that the VH can be used to study cognitive theories IFF the systems can respondin realtime

we undersnad the mind by simulating the actions of the body

# standout

Along with enhanced experimental control, ease of manipulations, consistency and controlled measurements, these features make VHs useful and reliable tools for studying social cognitions.


Translating these theories and findings into working software requires the integration of advanced capabilities from a number of domains of computer science research including machine perception, rtificial intelligence, cognitive modeling, graphics and animation. 


The Virtual Human
Toolkit is a general-purpose collection of integrated VH
capabilities, including speech recognition, natural language
processing, perception, and nonverbal behavior generation
& execution.
