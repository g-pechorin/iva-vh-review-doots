
- interactive applications are harder to test (and debug) as the stuff isn't always easy to reproduce in a simulated session
- frp offers to let the whole program operate as if it is a pure functional entity
- potential to record and replay sessions with greater and greater amounts of assertions until the cause of some aberant befhaviour can be loacted


- the approach separates the IO from the logical operations
	- i'm unfamiliar with lienear temporal logic
- the separation allows transfering event traces from/to other computers and replaying them
	- this is then demonstraed with an extended version of the framework
	- advocay for temproarl logic might be worth exploring once any challenges are seen
