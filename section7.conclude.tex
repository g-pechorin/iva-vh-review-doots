- [The approach here isn't focussed on building "master APIs" for the lines of communication between components, but, rather a system to automatically generate and check the interconnections between those components.]
    - [The intent is to support flexible working; incompatible interface changes should cause type errors, and aberrant states can be reproduced and analysed.]
- [Agents Scenarios are not reliant upon an external encoding or communications system, nor can they easily buildup state that'll introduce aberrant behaviour - they stay "fresh" in a "just turned on" state.]

- [The shell we propose enforces consistent input and output operations from the agent.]
    - [If the agent fails to specify or read a value for something there will be an immediate error; enforcing consistent behaviour.]
- [These aspects are currently "enforced" by our implementation, prior work has identified a method to enforce it as a compile-time constraint.\cite{winograd2012wormholes}]

- [Additionally the strict delineations between "agent" and "shell" afford additional options for testing and diagnosis.]
    - [A "built-in" strict separation isn't required for "good" testing, but, it's helpful and considered a good practice anyway.]
- [The proposed component integration decouples them from the simulation - making "headless running" of the bound components "practical" compared to a more "tight" integration.]
    - [Nothing stops component developers from doing this on their own, but, this enforces a consistent structure so that one might be able to test them similarly.]
- [Finally, as noted elsewhere, abstracting the FFI into and out of the agent as streams of data means that the agent (or components) can be tested against previous sessions, and, re-played to re-reach a previous state.]
    - [Again; due to Turning Completeness - any system could do this with enough work, but, this approach "supports" it.]

- [Prior work has shown both that FRP approaches are quite suited to testing\cite{perez2017testing} and that automated testing of PFP itself can be quite useful in determining "edge cases"\cite{claessen2011quickcheck} which would otherwise be a challenge to diagnose.]
    - [The ability to abstract and encode all invocations coming in and out of the system as distinct data points are key to this.]
