	abstract = {Science fiction has long imagined a future populated with artificial humans–human-looking devices with human-like intelligence. Although Asimov's benevolent robots and the Terminator movies' terrible war machines are still a distant fantasy, researchers across a wide range of disciplines are beginning to work together toward a more modest goal–building virtual humans. These software entities look and act like people and can engage in conversation and collaborative tasks, but they live in simulated environments. With the untidy problems of sensing and acting in the physical world thus dispensed, the focus of virtual human research is on capturing the richness and dynamics of human behavior.},
