		abstract = {Science fiction has long imagined a future populated with artificial humans–human-looking devices with human-like intelligence. Although Asimov's benevolent robots and the Terminator movies' terrible war machines are still a distant fantasy, researchers across a wide range of disciplines are beginning to work together toward a more modest goal–building virtual humans. These software entities look and act like people and can engage in conversation and collaborative tasks, but they live in simulated environments. With the untidy problems of sensing and acting in the physical world thus dispensed, the focus of virtual human research is on capturing the richness and dynamics of human behavior.},

		abstract = {Modern virtual agents require knowledge about their environment, the interaction itself, and their interlocutors' behavior in order to be able to show appropriate nonverbal behavior as well as to adapt dialog policies accordingly. Recent achievements in the area of automatic behavior recognition and understanding can provide information about the interactants' multimodal nonverbal behavior and subsequently their a?ective states. In this paper, we introduce a perception markup language (PML) which is a ?rst step towards a standardized representation of perceived nonverbal behaviors. PML follows several design concepts, namely compatibility and synergy, modeling uncertainty, multiple interpretative layers, and extensibility, in order to maximize its usefulness for the research community. We show how we can successfully integrate PML in a fully automated virtual agent system for healthcare applications.},
